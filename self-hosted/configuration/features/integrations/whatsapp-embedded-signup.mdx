WhatsApp Embedded Signup enables users to connect their WhatsApp Business accounts through Meta's streamlined OAuth flow without manual webhook configuration. This significantly improves the user experience by automating the entire setup process.

## Prerequisites

1. A valid Facebook account
2. A WhatsApp Business account (or ability to create one)
3. Admin access to your Chatwoot installation

## Super Admin Configuration

Before users can use WhatsApp Embedded Signup, administrators must configure the following environment variables via the Super Admin panel at `/super_admin/app_config?config=whatsapp_embedded`:

- **WHATSAPP_APP_ID**: The Facebook App ID for WhatsApp Business API integration
- **WHATSAPP_CONFIGURATION_ID**: The Configuration ID for WhatsApp Embedded Signup flow (obtained from Meta Developer Portal)
- **WHATSAPP_APP_SECRET**: The App Secret for WhatsApp Embedded Signup flow (required for token exchange)

<Note>
These settings must be configured by a Super Admin before the WhatsApp Embedded Signup option becomes available to users.
