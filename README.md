## Installation

```console
pnpm install
```

## Local Development

```console
pnpm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```console
pnpm build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

Please feel free to suggest any changes. See our [contributing guide](https://www.chatwoot.com/docs/contributing-guide) to get started.
