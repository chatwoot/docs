# Setup Telegram app integration on your local machine

Please follow the steps if you are trying to work with the Telegram integration on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

- Telegram Bot Token from [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)
- Ngrok or similar tunneling service
- Running Chatwoot development environment

## Setup Steps

### 1. Start Ngrok Server

Start a Ngrok server listening at port `3000` or the port you will be running the Chatwoot installation:

```bash
# Install ngrok if you haven't already
# Download from https://ngrok.com/download

# Start ngrok tunnel
ngrok http 3000
```

### 2. Update Environment Variables

Update the `.env` variable `FRONTEND_URL` in Chatwoot with the `https` version of the Ngrok URL:

```bash
# In your .env file
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-ngrok-subdomain.ngrok.io
```

### 3. Start Chatwoot Server

Start the Chatwoot server and create a new Telegram channel with the token obtained from Telegram BotFather.

```bash
# Start the development server
make run
# or
foreman start -f Procfile.dev
```

### 4. Create Telegram Channel

1. **Access Chatwoot**: Go to your Chatwoot instance (http://localhost:3000)
2. **Navigate to Settings** â†’ **Inboxes** â†’ **Add Inbox**
3. **Select Telegram** as the channel type
4. **Enter Bot Token**: Paste the token you received from BotFather
5. **Configure Channel**: Set up the channel name and other settings

## Verify Webhook Registration

While creating the channel, Chatwoot should have registered a webhook callback URL in Telegram for your Bot. You can verify whether this URL registration was done successfully by calling the Telegram API:

```bash
GET https://api.telegram.org/bot{your_bot_token}/getWebhookInfo
```

## Testing the Integration

If the webhook is registered correctly with Telegram, your Ngrok server should receive events for new Telegram messages, and new conversations will be created in Chatwoot.

### Test Steps

1. **Send a message** to your Telegram bot
2. **Check Ngrok logs** to see if the webhook request is received
3. **Check Chatwoot** to see if a new conversation is created
4. **Reply from Chatwoot** to test bidirectional communication

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Webhook not registered">
**Problem**: Telegram webhook registration fails

**Solution**:
- Ensure your Ngrok URL is accessible publicly
- Check that `FRONTEND_URL` is set correctly in your `.env` file
- Verify the bot token is correct
- Restart Chatwoot after updating environment variables
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Messages not appearing in Chatwoot">
**Problem**: Telegram messages don't create conversations in Chatwoot

**Solution**:
- Check Ngrok logs for incoming webhook requests
- Verify the webhook URL in Telegram using the API call above
- Check Chatwoot logs for any error messages
- Ensure the channel is properly configured and enabled
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="SSL/TLS errors">
**Problem**: SSL certificate issues with webhook

**Solution**:
- Use the `https` version of your Ngrok URL
- Ensure Ngrok is running properly
- Try restarting Ngrok and updating the webhook
</Accordion>

## Next Steps

After successful setup:

1. **Test message flow** between Telegram and Chatwoot
2. **Configure agent assignments** for Telegram conversations
3. **Set up automated responses** if needed
4. **Review webhook logs** for debugging
