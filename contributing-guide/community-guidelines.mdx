# Chatwoot Community Guidelines

Welcome to the Chatwoot community! These guidelines help ensure our community remains welcoming, productive, and inclusive for everyone.

## General Principles

### 1. Respect and Inclusivity
Everyone is welcome here. Treat all members with respect, regardless of their background, identity, or level of experience.

### 2. Collaboration Over Conflict
Always approach discussions and feedback with a constructive attitude. We're all here to learn and grow together.

### 3. No Spam or Self-Promotion
Unsolicited advertisements, promotions, or spammy links are not allowed. Share valuable content that benefits the community.

## Platform-Specific Guidelines

### Discord-Specific Guidelines

Our Discord server is where the community gathers for real-time discussions, support, and collaboration.

#### Channel Etiquette

1. **Stay On Topic**: Each channel has its purpose. Ensure your discussions are relevant to the channel topic.
2. **Use Thread Responses**: For lengthy discussions, use thread replies to keep channels organized.
3. **Search Before Asking**: Check pinned messages and recent discussions before asking questions.

#### Content Guidelines

1. **No NSFW Content**: This is a professional community. Do not share or promote any NSFW content.
2. **Quality Over Quantity**: Focus on helpful, meaningful contributions rather than frequent low-value messages.
3. **Appropriate Language**: Keep language professional and appropriate for a business environment.

#### Voice Channels

1. **Microphone Etiquette**: Ensure your microphone is muted when not speaking.
2. **Respect Speaking Time**: Avoid interrupting others and allow everyone to participate.
3. **Background Noise**: Use push-to-talk if you're in a noisy environment.

#### Reporting and Support

1. **Report Violations**: If you see someone violating these guidelines, don't engage. Instead, report it to the moderators.
2. **Use Private Messages**: For sensitive issues, reach out to moderators via private message.

### GitHub-Specific Guidelines

GitHub is our primary platform for code collaboration, issue tracking, and project management.

#### Issue Reporting

1. **Search First**: Before reporting a bug or requesting a feature, search the issues to ensure it hasn't been addressed already.
2. **Use Templates**: Follow the provided issue templates for bug reports and feature requests.
3. **Provide Details**: Include clear steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and actual behavior.
4. **Stay Updated**: Monitor your issues for questions from maintainers and respond promptly.

#### Pull Requests

1. **Clear Descriptions**: Ensure your PRs are concise, have a clear title, and are linked to relevant issues.
2. **Follow Style Guide**: Adhere to the existing coding style and conventions.
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Test your changes in multiple scenarios before submitting.
4. **Respond to Reviews**: Address feedback constructively and make requested changes promptly.

#### Code Review Guidelines

1. **Be Constructive**: Provide specific, actionable feedback rather than general criticism.
2. **Explain Reasoning**: When suggesting changes, explain why the change would improve the code.
3. **Appreciate Good Work**: Acknowledge good code and clever solutions.
4. **Stay Professional**: Keep discussions focused on the code, not the person.

#### Documentation

1. **Update Documentation**: If your PR introduces a new feature, ensure that it's documented.
2. **Fix What You See**: If you spot outdated or missing documentation, consider updating it or raising an issue.
3. **Clear Examples**: Provide clear, working examples in documentation.
