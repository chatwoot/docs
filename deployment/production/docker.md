### Deploying with docker

We publish our base images to docker hub. Build your web/worker images from these base images

### Web

```
FROM chatwoot/chatwoot:latest
RUN chmod +x docker/entrypoints/rails.sh
ENTRYPOINT ["docker/entrypoints/rails.sh"]
CMD bundle exec bundle exec rails s -b 0.0.0.0 -p 3000
```

### worker

```
FROM chatwoot/chatwoot:latest
RUN chmod +x docker/entrypoints/rails.sh
ENTRYPOINT ["docker/entrypoints/rails.sh"]
CMD bundle exec sidekiq -C config/sidekiq.yml
```

The app servers will available on port `3000`. Ensure the images are connected to the same database and Redis servers. Provide the configuration for these services via environment variables.

### Initial database setup

To setup the database for the first time, you must run `rails db:chatwoot_prepare`. You may get errors if you try to run `rails db:migrate` at this point.

### Upgrading

Update the images using the latest image from chatwoot. Run the `rails db:migrate` option after accessing console from one of the containers running latest image.
