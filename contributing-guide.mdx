# Contributing Guide

Thank you for taking an interest in contributing to Chatwoot! This guide will help you get started with contributing to our open-source customer support platform. Before submitting your contribution, please make sure to take a moment and read through the following guidelines.

## Getting Started

<Warning>
Before starting your work, ensure an issue exists for it. If not, feel free to create one. You can also take a look into the issues tagged [Good first issues](https://github.com/chatwoot/chatwoot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).
</Warning>

### Initial Steps

1. **Check for Existing Issues**: Browse the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/chatwoot/chatwoot/issues) to see if someone is already working on what you want to contribute.

2. **Comment on the Issue**: Add a comment on the issue and wait for the issue to be assigned before you start working on it.
   - This helps to avoid multiple people working on similar issues.

3. **Propose Complex Solutions**: If the solution is complex, propose the solution on the issue and wait for one of the core contributors to approve before going into the implementation.
   - This helps in shorter turn around times in merging PRs.

4. **Justify New Features**: For new feature requests, provide a convincing reason to add this feature. Real-life business use-cases will be super helpful.

5. **Join the Community**: Feel free to join our [Discord community](https://discord.com/invite/cJXdrwS) if you need further discussions with the core team.

## Pull Request Guidelines

<Info>
We use git-flow branching model. The base branch is `develop`. Please raise your PRs against the `develop` branch.
</Info>

### Before Submitting

- Please make sure that you have read the [issue triage guidelines](https://www.chatwoot.com/hc/handbook/articles/issue-triage-29) before you make a contribution.
- It's okay and encouraged to have multiple small commits as you work on the PR - we will squash the commits before merging.
- For other guidelines, see [PR Guidelines](https://www.chatwoot.com/hc/handbook/articles/pull-request-guidelines-32)
- Ensure that all the text copies that you add into the product are i18n translatable. You are only required to add the `English` version of the strings. We pull in other language translations from our contributors on crowdin. See [Translation guidelines](https://www.chatwoot.com/docs/contributing-guide/translation-guidelines) to learn more.

## Development Workflow

### Developing a New Feature

```bash
# Create a branch in the following format:
feature/<issue-id>-<issue-name>

# Example:
feature/235-contact-panel
```

**Requirements:**
- Add accompanying test cases
- Follow our coding standards
- Include proper documentation

### Bug Fixes or Chores

```bash
# Branch naming for bug fixes:
fix/<issue-id>-<issue-name>

# Branch naming for chores:
chore/<description>
```

**Requirements:**
- If you are resolving a particular issue, add `fix: Fixes xxxx` (#xxxx is the issue) in your PR title
- Provide a detailed description of the bug in the PR
- Add appropriate test coverage if applicable
