## Troubleshooting & Common Errors

Ensure the Instagram user is added as a developer: `Meta Dashboard → App Roles → Roles → Add People → Enter Instagram ID`

### API Access Deactivated

Ensure the **Privacy Policy URL** is valid and correctly set.

### Invalid request: Request parameters are invalid: Invalid redirect_uri

Please configure the Frontend URL. The Frontend URL does not match the authorization URL.

Please make sure that tester account has been added to the facebook app settings.

### 400: Session Invalid when connecting the instagram channel

This might be issue from facebook side. Please try again after some time.
