# Translate Chatwoot to Your Language

Chatwoot uses American English by default. Each and every string available in Chatwoot can be translated to the language of your choice. Chatwoot uses Crowdin to manage the translation process. The updates from Crowdin are also included along with every release.

## How do I see the strings that need to be translated?

In the codebase, the strings are placed in the following locations:

- `app/javascript/dashboard/i18n` - The strings related to the agent dashboard
- `app/javascript/widget/i18n` - The strings related to the web widget
- `app/javascript/survey/i18n` - The strings related to CSAT surveys
- `config/locales` - The strings used in backend messages or API responses

You can login to **Crowdin** ([https://translate.chatwoot.com](https://translate.chatwoot.com)) and create an account to view the strings that need to be translated.

## How to contribute?

If you don't find your language on Crowdin, please create an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/chatwoot/chatwoot/issues) to add the language.

### Translate Strings

The translation process for Chatwoot web and mobile app is managed at [https://translate.chatwoot.com](https://translate.chatwoot.com) using Crowdin. You will have to create an account at Crowdin before you can select a language and contribute.

### Translation Guidelines

#### Formal vs Informal Context

At Chatwoot, we prefer to use formal form of language wherever possible. For instance in German there are two forms of "you" where one is rather used in formal contexts ("Sie") and the other one is used among friends ("Du"). "Sie" is preferred over "Du" in translating Chatwoot.

#### Consistency Guidelines

- **Maintain consistency** across similar contexts and features
- **Use standard terminology** for technical terms when available in your language
- **Keep placeholders intact** - Don't translate variables like `{name}` or `%{count}`
- **Preserve formatting** - Maintain HTML tags, markdown, and line breaks
- **Consider context** - UI strings may need to be shorter than descriptive text

#### Brand and Product Names

- **Chatwoot** - Always keep as "Chatwoot" (don't translate)
- **Feature names** - Translate feature names but maintain consistency
- **Third-party services** - Keep original names (GitHub, Slack, etc.)

### Proofreading

Proofreading helps ensure the accuracy and consistency of translations. Right now, the translations are being accepted without a proofreading step. This would be changed in the future as and when there are more contributors for each language.

<Warning>
If you are the only person contributing to a language, make sure that you inform any of the Chatwoot members to gain access to manage the language.
</Warning>

### Releasing a New Language

All the translated strings would be included in the next release. If a language has **60% or more translated strings** in Crowdin, we would enable the language in Chatwoot app during the next release.

#### Steps to Raise a Pull Request for New Language

Please use this [pull request](https://github.com/chatwoot/chatwoot/pull/7905) as a reference for enabling a new language into Chatwoot.

- Ensure language is added and enabled in `config/initializers/languages.rb`
- Include the language in `i18n/index.js` for all the packs ‚Üí `dashboard, widget, survey`
- Select the language from Chatwoot settings UI and confirm the PR to be working
