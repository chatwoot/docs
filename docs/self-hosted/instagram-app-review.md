## `instagram_business_basic`

### Why you are requesting this permission

[BRAND_NAME] is a customer support platform that allows businesses to manage conversations across multiple messaging platforms â€” including Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook, and more â€” through a unified inbox.

This permission is used to:

- Retrieve basic metadata (username, user ID, and profile picture) of connected Instagram Business accounts during onboarding.
- Display sender information (username and ID) when customers message the business through Instagram.

This metadata is essential for correct routing of messages to the appropriate agent, identification of the agent handling the conversation, and accurate profile display in the chat UI, ensuring a seamless customer experience.

- **App URL:** [DASHBOARD_URL]
- **Test Account:**
  - Email: [EMAIL]
  - Password: [PASSWORD]

## `instagram_business_manage_messages`

### Why you are requesting this permission

[BRAND_NAME] is a customer support platform that allows businesses to manage conversations across multiple messaging platforms â€” including Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook, and more â€” through a unified inbox.

This permission allows the platform to manage and respond to Instagram messages on behalf of the connected Instagram Business account.

It is used to:

- Receive messages via the Instagram webhook.
- Display conversations in the agent inbox.
- Allow agents to reply from within the platform.
- Keep conversations synced in real time.

The webhook setup works by configuring a URL endpoint on the platform to receive incoming messages from Instagram. When a message is sent to the connected Instagram Business account, it triggers a webhook event that delivers the message to the specified endpoint. The backend processes this message, stores it in the database, and updates the agent's inbox in real time.

Without this permission, users would not be able to communicate with their Instagram audience via the support platform.

- **App URL:** [DASHBOARD_URL]
- **Test Account:**
  - Email: [EMAIL]
  - Password: [PASSWORD]

### Screencast Walkthrough

**Please include a video showing the following steps:**

1. Log in to the dashboard.
2. Connect an Instagram Business account as described in the previous section.
3. From another Instagram user account, send a direct message to the connected business.
4. Show that the message appears in the inbox UI.
5. Reply from the inbox.
6. Switch back to Instagram to show that the user received the reply.
7. Demonstrate real-time syncing.

## `human_agent`

### Why you are requesting this permission

[BRAND_NAME] is a customer support platform that allows businesses to manage conversations across multiple messaging platforms â€” including Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook, and more â€” through a unified inbox.

We are requesting the Human Agent permission to allow support agents to follow up on customer conversations beyond the 24-hour window, especially when customers reach out after business hours or over the weekend.

Example use case:

- A customer sends a message Friday night.
- The business is closed on weekends.
- On Monday morning, the agent cannot reply because the 24h window has expired.
- With the Human Agent tag, the agent can now follow up on Monday morning and resolve the query.

This enhances customer experience and ensures critical messages are not left unresolved due to timing limitations.

This permission is essential to allow human agents to continue conversations in a natural, respectful, and supportive way without forcing customers to message again just to reopen the window.

- **App URL:** [DASHBOARD_URL]
- **Test Account:**
  - Email: [EMAIL]
  - Password: [PASSWORD]

---

### Screencast Walkthrough

**Please include a video showing the following steps:**

1. Log in to the platform.
2. Open an existing Instagram conversation that is **older than 24 hours**.
3. Attempt to respond to the message and explain how current Meta policy restricts the reply.
4. Explain why a response is still needed â€” for example, the support agent was unavailable during a weekend or the issue required escalation.
5. Describe how the `human_agent` tag will be used to allow the response within the extended 7-day window.

## Notes

- Do not include Instagram account credentials.
- Only share test dashboard credentials (non-super admin access recommended).
- Ensure your screencast clearly shows the platform UI and relevant workflows.
- Keep your permission usage aligned with Metaâ€™s policy for message tags and user privacy.
- Speak aloud or add captions in your video for reviewer clarity.
- Video should be as much as detailed as possible.

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Use a screen recorder that captures mouse interactions, popups, and browser activity to clearly demonstrate authentication flows and inbox interactions.
