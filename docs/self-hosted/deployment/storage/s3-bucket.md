            "Sid": "Stmtxxx",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "your-user-arn"
            },
            "Action": [
                "s3:DeleteObject",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:PutObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name",
