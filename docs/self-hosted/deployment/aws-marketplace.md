## Configuring Chatwoot

To configure Chatwoot, we need to ssh into the instance. We will use `AWS console connect` for this.

1. Select the instance and click on `Connect`.

2. Change the username from `root` to `ubuntu` and click `Connect`.

3. Switch to the `chatwoot` user and configure the necessary environment variables. Refer [Environment variables](https://www.chatwoot.com/docs/self-hosted/configuration/environment-variables) document for the complete list.
```bash
sudo -i -u chatwoot
cd chatwoot
vi .env
```

6. Also, it is recommended to configure a proxy server like Nginx and set up SSL. Make sure to modify the security group created in `step 6` accordingly.

### Updating the instance
Please follow the Chatwoot update process in the standard Linux VM setup.
