This guide outlines the necessary configurations for deploying Chatwoot in environments with restricted internal networks, ensuring full functionality and compliance.

## Activating Licenses

Licensing is critical for the operational legality and functionality of Chatwoot:

### Whitelist Licensing Server

Add `https://hub.2.chatwoot.com` to your network's whitelist for license activation and management of Stripe payment links.

### Switch to Email Invoices

For organizations preferring email invoices, contact our sales team at `sales@chatwoot.com` with your installation identifier to configure this billing option.

## Enabling ChatWidget for Users

To ensure seamless functionality of the ChatWidget within restricted networks, perform the following configurations:

### WebSockets

Enable WebSocket connections through `wss://yourdomain.com/cable` to facilitate real-time communications.

### Widget API URLs

Open all API endpoints under the widget path to ensure full functionality. Configure your network to allow access to:

```
https://yourdomain.com/api/v1/widget/*
```

This wildcard approach ensures all necessary widget functionalities such as conversation handling, message management, and contact updates are operable without individual endpoint specifications.

### Widget Assets

Make sure that static assets required by the ChatWidget are accessible. These are typically served from:

```
https://yourdomain.com/packs
```

Ensure all paths under this directory are accessible to support the widget fully.

## SMTP Configuration for Emails

Proper SMTP setup is essential for managing email communications within restricted networks:

### SMTP Server Details

Configure your SMTP server to handle outgoing emails from Chatwoot, including server address, port, authentication details, and secure connection protocols.

### Secure Connections

Employ TLS/SSL for secure email transmissions, ensuring your network permits connections over the designated SMTP port (commonly 587 for TLS).

## Additional Configuration for Restricted Networks

Additional considerations are necessary for the optimal operation of Chatwoot in restricted environments:

### DNS Configuration

Ensure DNS settings are optimized to reduce resolution times and enhance the accessibility of Chatwoot services.

### SSL/TLS Configuration

Maintain up-to-date SSL/TLS certificates that are compatible with all internal systems and browsers.

### Monitoring and Logging

Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging solutions to swiftly detect and address potential disruptions, maintaining system stability and performance.

<Note>
By following these detailed instructions, your Chatwoot deployment can effectively operate within restricted network environments, ensuring a robust and secure customer support platform.
