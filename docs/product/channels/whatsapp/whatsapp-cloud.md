# How to configure WhatsApp Cloud in Chatwoot?

## Prerequisites

### Configure your Facebook Developer App

Follow the `Set up Developer Assets and Platform Access` step in [Whatsapp Cloud API Guide](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/get-started) to create your Facebook Developer app with `Whatsapp Product` enabled.

Once you finish this step, you can now configure your required phone numbers in the `Whatsapp` section of your Facebook developer app.
If you complete the steps successfully, you should be able to obtain the `Phone Number Id` and `Whatsapp Bussiness Account ID` as shown in the below screenshot. Chatwoot will require these values for creating the Whatsapp Inbox.

Head back to the `Whatsapp` section in Facebook Developer App. Navigate to the `Configuration` subsection and set up the `Callback URL`
- The value for the url should be the same URL you obtained at the end of your Chatwoot inbox creation and will look like `https://app.chatwoot.com/webhooks/whatsapp/+{phone_number}`.

You should also subscribe to message fields events under Webhooks Fields on your Facebook Developer app. Once you finish all the steps, the section should look like the below screenshot.

## FAQ

### How to configure multiple numbers under a single Facebook app?

Facebook App allows configuring only a single Webhook endpoint. So create Inboxes in Chatwoot for all the numbers as required. You will need to configure the Webhook url provided for only one of these inboxes in the Facebook app for all the other inboxes to work.
