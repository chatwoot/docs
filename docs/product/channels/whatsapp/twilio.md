To connect a **WhatsApp** channel, you have to configure a callback URL in the Twilio inbox. Follow the steps below.

- Login to your Twilio Console.
- Go to `Programmable SMS -> Whatsapp -> Senders`.
- You will be able to see your phone number. Click on it. It will display a field like the one shown below.

![twilio_console](../images/whatsapp/twilio-setup.png)

- Provide `https://app.chatwoot.com/twilio/callback` as the value for `WHEN A MESSAGE COMES IN` input.

## Configuring Chatwoot with Twilio Studio 

If you are using Twilio Studio for a custom conversation flow, updating the webhook URL directly will break your existing integration.

For such cases you can follow the steps given below.

1. Identify the step in your flow where you want the `agent handoff` to happen.
2. Add a `make http request widget` as shown below with the given values.

![twilio_studio](../images/whatsapp/twilio-studio-setup.png)

**REQUEST METHOD** : POST

**REQUEST URL**: [https://app.chatwoot.com/twilio/callback](https://app.chatwoot.com/twilio/callback)

**CONTENT TYPE**: Application/JSON

**REQUEST BODY**: `{{trigger.message | to_json }}` ( make changes as required based on your flow variables).

> HTTP request widget will forward the message body to Chatwoot. This will create a conversation in Chatwoot from where the agent can reply.

3. Make sure that your flow can handle the user responses to Agent Replies.

## Additional Inbox settings[](https://www.chatwoot.com/docs/product/channels/twitter#additional-inbox-settings)

Your freshly configured WhatsApp inbox should now appear in your list of inboxes. To see this and to make additional settings in your WhatsApp inbox, go to Settings → Inboxes → click the gear icon on the associated WhatsApp inbox. 

All the additional settings available are the same as those in your Twitter inbox. We recommend going through [this link](/docs/product/channels/twitter#additional-inbox-settings) to understand the same.
