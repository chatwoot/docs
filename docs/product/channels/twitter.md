If you are using a self-hosted Chatwoot installation, please setup your Twitter inbox as described in [this guide](/docs/self-hosted/configuration/features/integrations/twitter-channel-setup).

_**NOTE: Twitter integration has been temporarily discontinued as a result of modifications made by Twitter to its APIs. This includes limitations on the number of requests raised per minute, plus substantial pricing changes.**_

For the cloud version of Chatwoot, please follow the steps below.

**Step 1**. Go to Settings → Inboxes → “Add Inbox”.

You can make some basic changes here. 

### Settings tab

**Enable channel greeting.** Once you enable this, Chatwoot will send a greeting message to new conversations created through your Twitter inbox.

**Enable CSAT**. Once you enable this, your Customer Satisfaction survey will be launched every time a ticket is resolved. The CSAT results can be viewed later in the Reports section.

### Collaborators tab

Click on the `Collaborators` tab. Here, you can add Agents to the Inbox or delete Agents who have been already added in the Inbox.

You can also enable or disable the automatic assignment of new conversations to the agents added to this inbox.
