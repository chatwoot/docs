### FAQ:

1. I am not able to see messages received in Facebook messenger in the connected Chatwoot inbox:

Ans: Please make sure your Facebook page is connected only to the Chatwoot app, as according to Facebook's new app development, all the apps need to build a handover protocol. https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/handover-protocol

We are working on the workaround for the same which would be available in the upcoming releases.
