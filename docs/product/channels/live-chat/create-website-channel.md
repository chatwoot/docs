## Additional Inbox settings

Scroll down to see more settings, where you can set up the various notifications you would like to receive when your website inbox starts functioning. 

![inbox_settings](./images/more-settings.png)

Here are a couple of examples for your understanding:

**Enable email collect box** is enabled by default. This means an automatic message to collect the e-mail id will be displayed once the customer starts a conversation. The customer/end user will receive a prompt to enter an e-mail id.

**Enable CSAT**. Once you enable this, your Customer Satisfaction survey will be launched every time a ticket is resolved. The CSAT results can be viewed later in the Reports section. 

Click on the **`Update`** button to save the changes you have made.

### Collaborators tab
