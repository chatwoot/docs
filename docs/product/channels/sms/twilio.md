## Configuring Chatwoot with Twilio Studio 

If you are using Twilio Studio for a custom conversation flow, updating the webhook URL directly will break your existing integration.

For such cases, you can [follow the steps given here](/docs/product/channels/whatsapp/twilio#configuring-chatwoot-with-twilio-studio).
