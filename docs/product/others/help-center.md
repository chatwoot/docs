With the Help Center feature, you can easily create a self-service portal for your customers to access articles and information. In this guide, we take you through the steps to set up a Help Center, including creating a portal and adding articles.

Please note that this is a beta feature that will constantly get updated with every release. You can set up your Help Center in three parts, as explained below.

## I. Creating a portal

**Step 1.** Click the Help Center icon from your sidebar, and click the "New Portal" button.

These fields are explained below:

   Upload your organization's logo.

2. **Name**

   Name your portal to refer to it internally.

3. **Slug**

   This will be auto-generated.

4. **Custom Domain (optional)**

   You can add the domain you want to serve your portal on a custom domain. For example, if your website is `yourdomain.com` and you want your portal accessible at `docs.yourdomain.com`, type that in this field.

Click "Create portal basic settings".

Your portal is ready. You can start adding categories and articles within these categories.

Categories exist to structure your portal and organize your articles. Follow these steps:

**Step 1.** Click the `+` sign alongside the Category section on the secondary sidebar to create a new category.

**Step 2.** A modal will open up. Fill up the fields.
