Starting from [Chatwoot `2.0`](https://www.chatwoot.com/blog/2-0-release-ee-edition-et-al/) ships two versions of its software. The Community edition which is `MIT` licenced and an Enterprise edition which is available under a [propretry license](https://github.com/chatwoot/chatwoot/blob/develop/LICENSE). Both versions of the software are build out a single [github repository](https://github.com/chatwoot/chatwoot).  

While the Community edition will remain always free and open-source, the enterprise edition is the effort to sustain both the offerings as well as Chatwoot 
as a commerical business. This model has been derived from the likes of other commercial open source companies like Gitlab, Mattermost, Metabase etc.

## Differences between Community and Enterprise editions

The Community edition of Chatwoot have all the relevant customer communication features that a growing business requires. While the enterprise edition contains proprietry features such as customisable dashboards, SLA Management, Agent scheduling software, IP blocklisting etc., suited for larger organizations.

While the source code for both the editions are open to public in our github repo, All the contents of the folder `/enterprise` is copyrighted.
