Websockets creates a persistent connection between the client and the server allowing bi-directional communication. Chatwoot supports a websocket connection to get real-time updates about the events happening on the platform. Any client can connect to the websocket URL in Chatwoot and authorize themselves by providing the token and start receiving the updates. This guide will help you set up a websocket connection with Chatwoot and integrate available events.

**Note:** This is an experimental feature. Documentation can change on every release, and there is no guarantee of backward compatibility. Please make sure that you are using the updated version of the implementation.

## Why should I use a websocket connection?

Suppose you are building a client for Chatwoot. For example, in An Android or iOS Client SDK, where you would need to listen to the latest messages to update the UI without a reload or An extension to the dashboard, if you want to improve an agent's productivity, you might need data in real-time.

## Setup a websocket connection with Chatwoot

To set up a websocket connection with Chatwoot, you need to initiate a connection with the authentication pubsub token provided by Chatwoot. The URL for the connection is `wss://<your-installation-url>/cable`. E.g.: `wss://app.chatwoot.com/cable`.

There are two types of pubsub tokens available in Chatwoot.

1. **User PubSub Token**: This token has the privileges of an agent/admin and would receive all of the events documented below. You can get the pubsub token by calling the [Profile API](https://www.chatwoot.com/developers/api/#operation/fetchProfile).

2. **Contact PubSub Token**: For every contact, Chatwoot would generate a pubsub token for every session they had. You can connect to the websocket using this token to get the updates of the current session. When you create a [contact using the public APIs](https://www.chatwoot.com/developers/api/#tag/Contacts-API), you will receive the `pubsub_token` in the payload. This token only have access to the current session related events, you would only receive the events `conversation.created`, `conversation.status_changed`, `message.created`, `message.updated`, `conversation_typing_on`, `conversation_typing_off` and `presence.update`.

Please refer [Client APIs](/docs/product/channels/api/client-apis) to build real time customer facing integrations using Chatwoot.

Note: This token may be rotated regularly based on your installation type, make sure that you are using the latest token.

### Connect to Chatwoot Websocket

You need to send a command "subscribe" to connect to Chatwoot. It expects a pubSub token, accountId and userId (if using a user token).
Here is an example on how you can connect with Chatwoot.

```js
// Add a helper method to convert JSON to a string
const stringify = (payload = {}) => JSON.stringify(payload);

const pubSubToken = "<contact/user-pub-sub-token>";
const accountId = "<your-account-id-in-integer>";
const userId = "<user-id-in-integer-if-using-user-token>";
const connection = new WebSocket(
  "wss://<your-Chatwoot-installation-host-url>/cable"
);

connection.send(
  stringify({
    command: "subscribe",
    identifier: stringify({
      channel: "RoomChannel",
      pubsub_token: pubSubToken,
      account_id: accountId,
      user_id: userId,
    }),
  })
);

// The expected string in connection.send is of the format:
// {"command":"subscribe","identifier":"{\"channel\":\"RoomChannel\",\"pubsub_token\":\"your-pubsub-token\",\"account_id\": account_id_integer,\"user_id\":user_id_integer }"}
```

### Publishing Presence to the websocket server

To keep your users online in Chatwoot, you can send a presence update event to Chatwoot every 30 seconds. This action would keep the status of the agent/contact to online.

#### Update presence of an agent/admin user

The payload that should be sent to the server for updating the presence of an agent/admin is as follows.

```js
const userPayload = stringify({
  command: "message",
  identifier: stringify({
    channel: "RoomChannel",
    pubsub_token: "<user-pubsub-token>",
    account_id: accountId,
    user_id: userId,
  }),
  data: stringify({ action: "update_presence" }),
});

connection.send(userPayload);
// The expected string in connection.send is of the format:
// {"command":"message","identifier":"{\"channel\":\"RoomChannel\",\"pubsub_token\":\"your-pubsub-token\",\"account_id\": account_id_integer,\"user_id\":user_id_integer ","data":"{\"action\":\"update_presence\"}"}
```

#### Update presence of a contact

The payload that should be sent to the server for updating the presence of a contact is as follows.

```js
const agentPayload = stringify({
  command: "message",
  identifier: stringify({
    channel: "RoomChannel",
    pubsub_token: "<user-pubsub-token>",
  }),
  data: stringify({ action: "update_presence" }),
});

connection.send(agentPayload);
// The expected string in connection.send is of the format:
// {"command":"message","identifier":"{\"channel\":\"RoomChannel\",\"pubsub_token\":\"your-pubsub-token\","data":"{\"action\":\"update_presence\"}"}
```
