If you frequently receive queries in languages you/your team members don't understand, you can utilize the Google Translate integration in Chatwoot. When enabled, you can instantly translate incoming messages using the right-click menu. This way, you can easily communicate with customers in their native language, even if you don't speak it yourself.

## How to enable Google Translate?
