Webhooks are HTTP callbacks that are defined in every account. These events are triggered when an action like message creation happens in Chatwoot. You can create more than one webhook for an account.

**Step 1** Click on the Integrations link in the settings sidebar. Next, click on "Configure" button.

**Step 2**. You will see the list of webhooks you have already added to the account.

![configure](./images/webhooks/configure.png)

**Step 3**. Click on the "Add new webhook", and it will display a modal where you can input the URL to which the POST request should be sent. Next, you need to select the events you want to subscribe. This option would allow you to only listen to the relevant events in Chatwoot.

Chatwoot will send a POST request with the following payload to the configured URLs for various updates happening in your account.
