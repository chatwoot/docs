Ongoing Campaigns allow the customer to send outbound messages in website live chat to their contacts which would trigger more conversations. You can create an ongoing campaign so that if a user visited a page and stayed for x minutes, you could send outbound message. This will help in more conversions.


**Step 1**. Click on the Campaigns tab in the sidebar. You will see the list of campaigns that you have already added to the inbox.
