Campaigns allow the customer to send outbound messages to their contacts which would trigger more conversations. Currently, campaigns are supported in website live chat and Twilio SMS/Whatsapp channels.

**Step 1**. Click on the Campaigns tab in the sidebar. You will see the list of campaigns that you have already added to the inbox.

There are 2 types of campaigns available.

1. One-off campaigns: For SMS channels, you can select a list of users and send one time outbound message.
2. Ongoing campaigns: For Website live-chat, you can create an ongoing campaign so that if a user visited a page and stayed for x minutes, you could send outbound message. This will help in more conversions.
