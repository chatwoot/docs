title: "Create your Chatwoot Account"

This guide will help you create your account on Chatwoot cloud or any of the self-hosted Chatwoot installations.

### I am using the self-hosted version

If you are using a self-hosted Chatwoot installation, you may directly open the URL `{your_installation_url}/app/auth/signup.`

P.S. We have a wholly different [guide](/docs/self-hosted) for self-hosted Chatwoot.

### I am using the cloud version

**Step 1**. If you want to use Chatwoot cloud, you may open [chatwoot.com](https://chatwoot.com) and click on the "Create a free account" button. This button takes you to the signup page.

The fields required to signup are as shown below. Fill up the fields.

| Field Name |  Description |
| -- | -- |
| Full Name | Enter Your Full name eg: John Hopkins |
| Work email | Enter a valid work e-mail address eg: *john.hopkins@companyname.com*  |
| Account name | Enter the name of your company eg: Wayne Enterprises |
| Password  | Password must contain at least one uppercase character (A-Z), at least one numeric character (0..9), and at least one special character `(!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}\|'"/\^.,`<\>:;?~)` |
| Confirm Password | Confirm password should match with the password given above |

**Step 3**. After signing up, you would be automatically logged into the dashboard. To complete the signup, you need to verify your email address. You will receive an email with the subject **Confirmation Instructions** from Chatwoot, as shown below.
