## Metrics in the CSAT Report

### Quick Overview

The upper half of your report will show metrics like this screenshot.

<div>

</div>

The following list explains what each metric means.

#### Total responses

This is the total number of responses received on your CSAT surveys, during the selected period and for the selected agent or agents.

#### Satisfaction score

This is the mean satisfaction score the survey takers gave, calculated using the following formula.

**`(Total number of positive ratings/Total number of responses) * 100`**

#### Response rate

This indicates the proportion of customers that responded to the CSAT surveys sent. It is calculated using the following formula.

**`(Total number of responses/Total number of CSAT survey requests sent) * 100`**

#### Emoji scale

Whenever a CSAT survey is requested from a customer, they are asked to rate their experience on an emoji scale like this:

<div>
<img src={require('../images/reports/csat_emoji_scale.png').default} width="800" alt="Chatwoot Home Screen" />
</div>

The emoji scale metrics that you see on your CSAT report show how many people (in percentage) used which emoji to rate their experience.

### Details of responses

The lower half of your report will list all the responses received. For eg., The screenshot below lists the CSAT survey responses received for agent Pranav Raj.
