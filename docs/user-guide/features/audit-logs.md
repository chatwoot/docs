Audit Logs is an Enterprise feature. This keeps a record of the activities occurring in your account, which you can track to audit your account, team, or services. Essentially, audit logs answer the four W's for you:

* Who

* What

* When

* Where

Or, **who** did **what**, **when** and from **where**?

## Where to find the Audit Logs within Chatwoot?

**Step 1.** If the feature is available to you, you can find it by going to 'Settings' -> 'Audit Logs'.

**Step 2.** Browse through your logs. Scroll down to find your desired entries or use the navigation to switch pages.

Pro tip: Use `cmd/ctrl + F` to quickly search for a desired entry.

You will find the entries under three headers: Activity, Time and IP Address.
