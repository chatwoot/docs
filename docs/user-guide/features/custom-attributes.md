title: "Custom Attributes"
---

Chatwoot supports custom attributes other than standard data attributes (a default set of data about your conversations/contacts like Name, Email, Location, etc.). A custom attribute tracks facts about your contacts/conversations. The custom attribute can be anything, E.g.:

- Subscription plan
- Subscribed date
- Signup date
- Most ordered item
- Ordered product link
- Last transaction date

> The only difference between custom and standard attributes is standard data attributes automatically get updated.

Custom data attributes are the information you attached to conversation/customers, like how many times they've ordered a product, when they signup, or what plan they're on. So you can set whatever attributes you want to understand your customer/conversation better, and it will all show in Chatwoot.

### Add a new custom attribute

To add a new custom attribute, navigate to the Custom Attributes by clicking on **Settings -> Custom Attributes** from the sidebar.

### Contact custom attributes

There two ways for setting custom attributes for contacts

#### 1. Set attributes via SDK method

To set a contact custom attributes call `setCustomAttributes` method as follows,

```js
window.$chatwoot.setCustomAttributes({
  key: value,
  // Key is a unique identifier which is already defined while creating a custom attribute
  // Value should be based on type (Currently support Number, Date, String and Number)
  // Double-check that your keys always have a JSON-valid value
  // You need to flatten nested JSON structure while using this function
});
```

Ex:

```js
window.$chatwoot.setCustomAttributes({
  plan: "premium",
  signUpDate: new Date(),
});
```

You can view these attributes in the contact side panel

To delete a custom attribute, use `deleteCustomAttribute` as follows

```js
window.$chatwoot.deleteCustomAttribute("attribute-key");
```

Ex:

```js
window.$chatwoot.deleteCustomAttribute("signUpDate");
```

> Prior to version v1.22 , all the attributes rendered as text. Please create new definition to display the value properly
