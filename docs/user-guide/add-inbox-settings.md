An Inbox connects your website, or social media accounts like Facebook, Twitter, or chat platforms like WhatsApp, Line, and more with Chatwoot.

You can have unlimited inboxes in your Chatwoot account.

You can add an inbox to your account in any of the 3 ways described below.

### I. Through your Welcome/onboarding screen

You’ll see the option to connect your inboxes on the onboarding screen.

Click on `Click here to create an inbox`, as shown in the screenshot below.

### II. Through your Settings screen

On your Chatwoot dashboard, click on Settings → Inboxes.

<div align="center">

<img src={require('./images/add-inbox-through-settings.png').default} width="800" alt="Chatwoot Home Screen" />

</div>

### III. Through your home screen

You can find the `+ New inbox` link on your home screen below the list of your inboxes.

<div align="center">

</div>

### Start adding inboxes

Once you reach the inbox screen, click on the button: “Add Inbox” which you will find at the top right hand corner of the page.

Start selecting channels. You can see the list of supported channels on this screen. Eg: Website, Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, SMS, Email, API, Telegram, Line, etc.

Inboxes would be connected to the front end Widgets placed in Website or other channels. Related: [Setting up Widget](/docs/user-guide/setting-up-chatwootwidget).
