title: "Add Labels"
---
Labels help you categorize conversations and prioritize them. You can assign a label to a conversation from the chat's side panel.

Labels are tied to the account and can be used to create custom workflows in your organization. You can assign custom colors to a label, which makes it easier to identify the label. You will be able to display the label on the sidebar to filter the conversations quickly.

To add labels, click on Settings on Chatwoot home screen. Go to Labels â†’ Add Label button.

<div align="center">

<img src={require('./images/adding-labels.png').default} width="800" alt="Chatwoot Dashboard home screen" />

</div>

You will see the screen (like shown below) where you can design your own label. 

As you add more labels, try to give them meaningful names as well as different colours to maintain distinction and clarity.
