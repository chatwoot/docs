This glossary describes terminology, products and services used at Chatwoot. This is a good place to start learning how to set up and use Chatwoot dashboard and mobile apps.

### @mention

@mentions allows agents to tag another agent(s) (not a contact) in a private note on a conversation. The mentioned agent(s) would get a notification about the conversation.

### Administrators

Administrators are the people who have access to administrative functions in Chatwoot, such as inviting new users, adding new conversation channels, adding integrations, etc. These people have access to all data in your account. Admins themselves are agents. They can choose to talk to a contact (end-user) if they opt to do it.

### Agents

Agents are the people who talk directly with the customers and answers their queries. They are also called support representatives. The administrators define the access levels for agents on inboxes and teams. The agents can only view the conversations created in the inboxes to which they have access.

### API

API is the acronym for an Application programming interface. API allows developers to access Chatwoot account programmatically and build custom integrations. See the [Developer API documentation](https://www.chatwoot.com/developers/api) for more details.

### Assignee (Assigned Agent)

An assignee or assigned agent is the agent in the account to whom the conversation is assigned to. Assignee defines the ownership of the conversation. The assignee would work with the contact (end-user) to solve their problems. If any help is required, the assignee can use @mention to invite the attention of other agents in the system.

### Assigned team

An assigned team is the team to which the conversation is assigned to. When there is a group of people with specific skills, you can create teams and assign certain conversations to specific teams. The ownership of the conversation lies with the assigned team.

### Audio notifications

The audio alert which indicates that a new message has arrived in a conversation is available in Chatwoot. You can subscribe to audio notifications for all the conversations in the inboxes you have access to or just the assigned conversation. Audio notifications notify you of a new message even if you work on something else in another browser tab.

### Bot

A bot is a short form of "Chatbot." Chatbot automates conversations by providing automated responses to the queries raised by customers. Chatbots help the customers troubleshoot the issues themselves, thereby reducing the number of conversations a human agent needs to cover. With Artificial intelligence and Machine learning, repetitive customer queries can be solved without handing them to an agent.

### Bulk import

Creating a large number of contacts one by one is a tedious task. Bulk import allows you to import a CSV which contains the details of all your contacts.

### Business hours

Business hours refers to your organization's working hours. Outside of the business hours, you can configure an unavailable message.

### Campaign

Campaigns allows you to send an outbound message to a list of customers. There are two types of campaigns in Chatwoot. One-off (one-time) campaigns and ongoing campaign.

### Canned Response

A canned response is a saved reply which is reusable and commonly used. For example, if there are frequently asked questions, the agents can save answers as canned responses and easily access them from the text editor. Moreover, canned responses allow agents to send a large text containing lists, URLs, rich content text, etc. in a single click, thereby improving their productivity.
