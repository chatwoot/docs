Under the Applications tab, we've already set up Dialogflow. This application will allow you to create automated responses in your conversation window. This way, you can let the bot handle the questions before handing them off to a customer service agent.

On the Chatwoot home screen, go to 'Settings' -> Applications. Click on Configure button against Dialogflow.

A new screen opens up where you can enter the Dialog flow ID and Key file that you already have registered.
