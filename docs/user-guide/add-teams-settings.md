title: "Add Teams"

Teams let you organize your agents into groups based on their responsibilities. A user can be part of multiple teams. You can assign conversations to a team when you are working collaboratively.

To start adding teams, go to Settings → Teams → Create new team.

You will see the screen shown below. Add Teams as per your need. Create Teams and group the issues/tickets to several groups such that assigned agents need to work in relevant teams only.
