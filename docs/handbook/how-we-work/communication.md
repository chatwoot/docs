title: 'Communication'
---

As we are working remotely, it is essential to have clarity in communication to work effectively. To support this, we practice **asynchronous communication** among the team. Most of the communication happens via Github Issues or Pull requests and through the internal Mattermost channel & user Discord channel.

### Values

**Positive Communication**: There are a lot of things broken at a startup. But many things are working well, too, if the startup is still staying afloat. So while we people might have inhibitions, It is always preferable to communicate from the perspective of "half-full cup vs. half-empty cup." This leaves a space for presenting the half-empty cup (risky situation) narrations in their seriousness. So we suggest having a viewpoint where you look at things as something that could improve vs. looking at everything from the perspective that it's broken.


### Written communciation

Written communication is preferred over a call. Although there might be instances where multiple people need to be in the same room, having a written document would provide context and help in the effective use of time.

To ensure that the discussions are documented somewhere, we prefer:
- Asking questions in public channels instead of DMs. If another person is having a similar problem, then we don't need to repeat it.
- Instead of jumping on a call, write the content down on Github/Notion. (e.g.: All product-related questions/thoughts can be added to the `contributing guide` or `product repository`. All internal process questions can be on the `public/private` handbook.)

#### Etiquette on Mattermost

Being on Mattermost channels can be distracting. So here are some guidelines on how we can reduce distractions:

- **@all** or **@here** mentions should be reserved for urgent or time-sensitive posts that require immediate attention by everyone in the channel. (e.g.: Requesting the team for QA server availability, Changing a meeting invite URL just before a meeting, or soliciting urgent help for a service disruption, where you're not sure who is immediately available)

- Make use of threads when responding to a post. This allows keeping information organized and less fragmented.
