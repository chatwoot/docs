## Merging a pull request

### Ownership 

For all external and internal contributions to chatwoot repositories, The team will triage the pull request and assign a PR owner. We use the assignee field in Github to denote the PR owner. The PR owner will work with the contributor to provide review comments, assist in testing or reassigning the pull request to another owner when required.

### Commit message

It is essential to add attribution to people who have contributed to the pull request. Please use `Co-authored-by:` at the end of the description.
