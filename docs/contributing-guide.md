This guide will help you get started with Chatwoot! Thank you for taking an interest in contributing to Chatwoot. Before submitting your contribution, please make sure to take a moment and read through the following guidelines:

### Getting Started

- Before starting your work, ensure an [issue](https://github.com/chatwoot/chatwoot/issues) exist for it. If not feel free to create one. You can also take a look into the issues tagged [Good first issues](https://github.com/chatwoot/chatwoot/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Good+first+issue%22).
- Add a comment on the issue and wait for the issue to be assigned before you start working on it.
  - This helps to avoid multiple people working on similar issues.
- If the solution is complex, propose the solution on the issue and wait for one of the core contributors to approve before going into the implementation.
  - This helps in shorter turn around times in merging PRs
- For new feature requests, Provide a convincing reason to add this feature. Real-life business use-cases will be super helpful.
- Feel free to join our [discord community](https://discord.gg/cJXdrwS), if you need further discussions with the core team.

### Pull Request Guidelines

- We use [git-flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) branching model. The base branch is `develop`
- Please raise your PRs against `develop` branch
- It's okay and encouraged to have multiple small commits as you work on the PR - we will squash the commits before merging.
- For other guidelines, please refer to [PR Guidelines](https://www.chatwoot.com/hc/handbook/articles/pull-request-guidelines-32)
- Ensure that all the text copies that you add into the product are i18n translatable. You are only required to add the `English` version of the strings. We pull in the other language translations from our contributors on crowdin. Ref [Translation guidelines](https://www.chatwoot.com/docs/contributing-guide/translation-guidelines) to learn more.
