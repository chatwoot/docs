### Pre-requisites

Before proceeding, make sure you have the latest version of `docker` and `docker-compose` installed.

As of now[at the time of writing this doc], we recommend a version equal to or higher than the following.

```bash
$ docker --version
Docker version 25.0.4, build 1a576c5
$ docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 2.24.7
```

## Development environment

1. Clone the repository.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/chatwoot/chatwoot.git
    ```

2. Make a copy of the example environment file and modify it as [required](/docs/self-hosted/configuration/environment-variables).

    ```bash
    # navigate to Chatwoot
    cd chatwoot
    cp .env.example .env
    # update redis and postgres passwords
    nano .env
    # update docker-compose.yml with the same postgres password
    nano docker-compose.yml
   ```

3. Build the images.

    ```bash
    # build base image first
    docker compose build base

    # build the server and worker
    docker compose build
    ```

4. After building the image or destroying the stack, you would have to reset the database using the following command.

    ```bash
    docker-compose run --rm rails bundle exec rails db:chatwoot_prepare
    ```

5. To run the app,

    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

    * Access the rails app frontend by visiting `http://0.0.0.0:3000/`
    * Access Mailhog inbox by visiting `http://0.0.0.0:8025/` (You will receive all emails going out of the application here)

    #### Login with credentials
    ```
        url: http://localhost:3000
        user_name: john@acme.inc
        password: Password1!
    ````

6. To stop the app,

    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```

### Running RSpec tests

For running the complete RSpec tests,

```bash
docker-compose run --rm rails bundle exec rspec
```

For running specific test,

```bash
docker-compose run --rm rails bundle exec rspec spec/<path-to-file>:<line-number>
```

## Production environment

To debug the production build locally, set `SECRET_KEY_BASE` environment variable in your `.env` file and then run the below commands:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yaml build
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yaml up
```

## Debugging mode

To use debuggers like `byebug` or `binding.pry`, use the following command to bring up the app instead of `docker-compose up`.

```bash
docker-compose run --rm --service-port rails
```


## Troubleshooting
If there is an update to any of the following
- `dockerfile`
- `gemfile`
- `package.json`
- schema change

Make sure to rebuild the containers and run `db:reset`.

```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose build
docker-compose run --rm rails bundle exec rails db:reset
docker-compose up
```
