### **General Principles:**

1. **Respect and Inclusivity:** Everyone is welcome here. Treat all members with respect, regardless of their background, identity, or level of experience.
2. **Collaboration Over Conflict:** Always approach discussions and feedback with a constructive attitude. We're all here to learn and grow together.
3. **No Spam or Self-Promotion:** Unsolicited advertisements, promotions, or spammy links are not allowed. Share valuable content that benefits the community.

### **Discord-Specific Guidelines:**

1. **Stay On Topic:** Each channel has its purpose. Ensure your discussions are relevant to the channel topic.
2. **No NSFW Content:** This is a professional community. Do not share or promote any NSFW content.
3. **Report Violations:** If you see someone violating these guidelines, don't engage. Instead, report it to the moderators.
4. **Voice Channels:** When in voice channels, avoid interrupting others and ensure your microphone is muted when not speaking.

### **GitHub-Specific Guidelines:**

1. **Issue Reporting:** Before reporting a bug or requesting a feature, search the issues to ensure it hasn't been addressed already.
2. **Pull Requests:** Ensure your PRs are concise, have a clear title, and are linked to relevant issues. Follow the existing coding style.
3. **Code of Conduct:** Adhere to the project's [Code of Conduct](/docs/contributing-guide/code-of-conduct). Discrimination, harassment, or any form of abuse will not be tolerated.
4. **Documentation:** If your PR introduces a new feature, ensure that it's documented. If you spot outdated or missing documentation, consider updating it or raising an issue.

### **Consequences for Violating Guidelines:**

1. **First Violation:** For most violations, you will receive a warning from the moderators. However, for critical violations like spam, immediate bans will be enforced.
2. **Repeated Violations:** Temporary or permanent ban, depending on the severity of the violation.

Refer [enforcement guidelines](/docs/contributing-guide/code-of-conduct#enforcement-guidelines) for more details.

### **Moderator and Admin Privileges**

1. **Selection Process:** Active contributors to the Chatwoot community, those who consistently offer valuable insights, help, and engagement, may be handpicked as moderators or granted specific privileges.
2. **Discretionary Decision:** The appointment of moderators and the granting of additional privileges are at the sole discretion of the Chatwoot team.
3. **Admin Privileges:** For compliance reasons, admin privileges in all Chatwoot communities are reserved exclusively for Chatwoot employees.
