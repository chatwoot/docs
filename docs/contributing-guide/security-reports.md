## Triaging Process

Chatwoot team triages the issues in Huntr weekly. We're doing our best to respond through Huntr as quickly as we can, So please don't open any public issues on GitHub or social media and avoid duplicate reports over Emails.

- Based on reviewing the report, the team will assign a priority to the issue and move it into the internal backlog to prioritize a fix.
- In cases where the team needs more information or disagreements of severity, the team will communicate the same over Huntr before completing the triaging.

After triage, the team will start working on the issue based on the following Severity and Timelines.

| Severity      | Timeline  |
| ------------- | --------- |
| Critical (P0) | Ô∏è  7 Days |
| High          | 30 Days   |
